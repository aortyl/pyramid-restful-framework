Configuration
=============
Currently there are three settings you can use to configure default behavior in PRF.

- default_pagination_class: A string representing the path to the default pagination class to use.
- page_size: An integer used as the default page size for pagination.
- default_permission_classes: A list or tuple of strings. Each string represents the path to a permissions class to use by default with each view.
